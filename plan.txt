ðŸ“Š Sales Insights System â€” Project Plan

1. Project Goal
- Deliver a simple analytics platform for sales insights (top sellers, revenue by region, trends) with a Python backend (MySQL, Pandas) and a Next.js frontend dashboard.

2. Current State
- Backend:
  - Analysis scripts: monthly_sales.py, sales_by_region.py, top_products.py
  - Database: init_sales.sql, populate_data.py
  - Main app: app.py
  - No data/ directory or sample CSV/Excel files found
- Frontend:
  - Next.js app with InsightCard and dashboard page
  - Minimal UI, no API integration yet

3. Missing/To-Do
- [ ] Add or locate sample sales data (CSV/Excel) for testing
- [ ] Ensure backend can load/process real data from DB
- [ ] Expose backend insights via API endpoints (Flask/FastAPI)
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API (fetch/display real insights)
- [ ] Polish dashboard UI (charts, loading states, error handling)
- [ ] (Optional) Add authentication, deployment scripts, or visualizations

4. Next Steps
- Step 1: Add/confirm sample data files for backend
- Step 2: Review/complete backend API endpoints
- Step 3: Connect frontend to backend API
- Step 4: Polish UI and add extra features as needed
